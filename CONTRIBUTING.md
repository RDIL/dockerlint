## Commands

### Install Dependencies

To install the needed dependencies, run `make install-deps`.

### Build Packages

To build your changes, just run `make` - you don't need to run this if you change `main.py`, but you will every time you change a file in `packages` and want to test.

### Run Cleanup

To clean up the unneeded files, you can run `make clean`.
